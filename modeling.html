		<p><b>What is precisely meant with the "model‚Äù to be developed?</b></p>
	
		<p>You will have to develop a mathematical model that describes the essential aspects of your energy storage and transport system. This model will encompass various components, describing various theories of physics. Specifically, you are required to model a time-dependent component of your system through a differential equation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_value_problem">boundary value problem<a>. The complexity of your model will most likely prohibit analytical evaluation and hence a computer model will be needed to evaluate the mathematical-physical model of your system.<p>
	
		<p><b>What is the purpose of the developed model in this project?</b></p>
	
		<p>
		As a part of the objective assessment of your idea, the primary performance characteristics of your system (efficiency, storage capacity, etc.) should be quantified. This quantification should be based on a model describing the physical behavior of your system which is relevant in relation to the considered performance indicators. Your assessment should be based on a preliminary design for the system, where the dimensions, material choices, etc. are determined using the model. Without a model it is not possible to form a quantitative objective assessment of your idea!
		</p>
	
		<p><b>What aspects of the system should be incorporated in the model?</b></p>
	
		<p>
		What aspects should be included in a model depends on the goal for which it is used. In the case of this project you should provide an objective assessment of the preliminary design of your energy storage and transport system. Therefore all aspects of the system that substantially influence this assessment should be incorporated. Including aspects that are too detailed for the purpose of the model should be avoided, as this unnecessarily increases the complexity of your model. In the development of the model you are expected to consider several options for the model components, and then to select the option that best fits the goal of your model.
		</p>
	
		<p><b>Is it required to validate the mathematical-physical model and to verify the computer model?</b></p>
	
		<p>
		Without proper validation and verification (see the infographic for the difference) the results of your model are not trustworthy and hence your assessment will not be meaningful. Building a representative experimental setup of your system will be challenging, but you should pursue to validate as many components of the model as possible. Besides conducting experiments, results reported in the literature can aid in the validation as well.
