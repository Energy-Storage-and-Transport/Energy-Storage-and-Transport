      <ul>
        <li> To professionally <em>organize as a team</em> to effectively and efficiently target the project challenges.
        <li> To <em>develop yourself as an individual</em> within the setting of the project.
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!--Kick-off and learning objectives-->
    <p>
      To be successful in the project it is important that your team collaborates smoothly and that all team members get the space to function optimally. To make a good start with this, during the kick-off meeting on the opening day of the project, together with your tutor, you will set working agreements. By discussing strengths and weaknesses of the team and its members, you will also identify knowledge/skill gaps. Based on this you will <em>define learning objectives for the team and for the members</em>.
    </p>

    <!--Personal development tasks-->
    <p>
      To make sure that your team functions well, it is important that all members feel confident regarding the tools to be used in the project. It is therefore <em>mandatory for each member</em> to complete the <a class="practical">measurement practical</a> and accompanying <a class="measurementtheory">theory assignment</a>, as well as a <a class="simulink">Simulink training</a>. Besides these mandatory personal development tasks it may also be useful to boost your <a href="https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/matlab-onramp/gettingstarted">MATLAB</a> and <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HomePage">Arduino</a> skills. If you are not yet comfortable with software to make professional and technical graphics (for example, Inkscape, IPE drawing editor, Powerpoint), you can work on this in the project.
    </p>

    <!--Tutor meetings-->
    <p>
      Throughout the project your team will meet twice a week with your tutor. In these <em>tutor meetings</em> you will discuss the work performed by the members, including its documentation, giving each other constructive feedback. In these meetings you will also identify tasks/actions and divide these fairly over the team. It is important that the allocated tasks are in line with the expressed individual learning objectives of the team members, and that all members conduct work in all tracks. In week 4, together with your tutor, you will perform a (formative) mid-term evaluation. Based on the feedback in this mid-term evaluation you can improve toward the final evaluation in week 9.
