    <h3 id="background">The energy transition: an engineering challenge</h3>
    <p>
    Realizing a more <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">sustainable future</a> with affordable and clean energy is one of the biggest societal challenges we face today. The process of making our energy system sustainable is referred to as the <em>energy transition</em>. Technological innovations across a wide range of disciplines are required to realize this transition.
    </p>

    <p>
    The energy transition poses tremendous challenges for engineers, both from a technological perspective and from the vantage point of sustainability. As an engineer of the future, you will likely be developing technology to enable the energy transition. While you do this, you are expected to take into consideration the effects that this technology has on our lives.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
    A major technological challenge in the energy transition is to accommodate our energy system to deal with the more fluctuating nature of green energy sources compared to conventional (fossil fuel based) energy sources. Where conventional energy production can be controlled reliably, renewable energy production depends on external factors over which we have limited control. In the current energy system, where a substantial part of the energy still comes from fossil fuels, the fluctuations in renewable energy production are leveled out by conventional energy production. With the share of renewable energy production increasing substantially in the years to come, the development of technology to deal with its fluctuations is necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the western world, energy exchange markets (for example <a href="https://www.epexspot.com/">EPEX SPOT</a> in The Netherlands) regulate the supply and demand of energy. To improve the competitiveness of green energy production, it is essential to make them less dependent on balancing by conventional energy sources. The ability to efficiently store green energy in situations when there is a surplus of production (for example, at night) and to deliver this stored energy when there is a surplus of demand (for example, during the day), is key to reducing the need for balancing. Currently, the storage capacity on the energy grid is limited, especially in countries without natural hydroelectric dams (such as the Netherlands). The development of <em>innovative energy storage and transport technologies</em> is essential to make green energy competitive, and, thereby, to enable the energy transition.

    <h3 id="challenge">Challenge-based learning</h3>
    <p>
      Energy Storage and Transport is a challenge-based learning (CBL) project, set in the context of the energy transition:
    </p>
    
    <div class="block challenge">
      <p>
        Your team is working in the R&D department of an oil & gas company. The company's ambition is to transform into a sustainable energy company. In order to ignite this transition, various teams in the company, including yours, are asked to come up with <em>innovative energy storage and transport initiatives</em>. In 7 weeks time, you are asked to deliver an objective assessment of the developed idea. The company representatives are not interested in listening to sales pitches, but instead want a <em>science-based analysis based on a validated model</em>. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3 id="projectgoals">Project goals</h3>
    <p>The overarching goal of this project is defined as:</p>
    <div class="block projectgoals">
      <p>
       To develop a mathematical-physical model for an energy storage and transport system, and to validate this model using experiments. Within the framework of challenge-based learning, the project groups independently define their own energy storage and transport solution.
      </p>

    </div>

    <p>In the process of accomplishing this overarching objective, the following learning goals will be achieved:</p>

    <div class="block learninggoals">
    <p>In this project you will learn to...</p>
    <ol>
      <li> ...define an energy transport and storage system with time-dependent behavior. The complexity of the system should be in line with the competence level expected from a second year engineering student, and should take into account the strengths and weaknesses of your project group.</li>
      <li>...apply a predefined modeling cycle when developing and validating a model. In the early stages of the project, your group should be able to identify the key components and possible bottlenecks in the various modeling phases and to establish a time line for the modeling process.</li>
      <li>
      ...apply known mathematical-physical concepts to model the time-dependent behavior of the selected system. Your group should be able to identify key components of the system and describe at least one of these components by a differential equation.</li>
      <li>...reflect on the validity of the model, and to develop a plan to experimentally validate a crucial, time-dependent, component of the system.</li>
      <li>...design and build an experimental set-up, in order to validate the identified critical, time-dependent, component of the system. In designing the experiment, your group should focus on reproducibility and accuracy.</li>
      <li>...perform experiments and process and analyze experimental data following good statistical practice. Your group should be able to draw conclusions regarding the validity of the model, and to propose model and experiment improvements based on the processed data.</li>
      <li>...draw conclusions and make recommendations regarding the applicability and economic viability of the considered energy transport and storage system in the real-world setting, making use of the validated model.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>To train you for performing the experimental validation, as part of this project, a measurement training is provided. In the measurement training, you will...</p>

    <ol start="8">
    <li>...use measurement equipment (sensors, filters, measurement cards, etc.) and corresponding software to interpret experimental data.</li>
    </ol>

      Please note the following:
      <ul>
        <li>The rubrics for the Go/No-go pitch, the poster and the technical report will be evaluated purely based on the submitted product. Hence, it is crucial that each of these deliverables goes through a thorough editorial process before submission. Please consider the following tips:
          <ul>
            <li>Have a complete concept version of each deliverable ready multiple days prior to the submission deadline.
            <li>Let all group members review the entire deliverable (not only their own contribution) and let them list their reviewing comments.
            <li>Let each group member score the deliverable based on the available rubric.
            <li>Discuss all reviewing comments and rubric-based self-evaluations with the entire group, and, if there are doubts regarding a rubric item, ask for clarification on the Canvas forum.
            <li>Make agreements on the processing of all comments, and, depending on the required changes, perform an additional second reviewing round.
            <li>Plan for a submission well before the deadline, so that there is time for final modifications if required.
          </ul>
        <li>Make sure to check the Canvas assessment page of the measurement training quiz and practical.
        <li>During the project, you will practice your presentation skills. Your tutor will evaluate this based on the rubric available <a href="assets/RubricPresentingSkills.pdf">here</a>.
        <li> ChatGPT and generative AI tools can support/enhance your learning. The overarching condition allowing the use of such tools is that you explain when they are used, and in what manner. In the case of doubts contact your tutor or coach.

      It is required that each student attends all meetings connected to the project, that is: all team meetings with the coach and all tutor meetings, all project-supporting lectures, training courses, student meetings, etc. Absence is only excused when it concerns an acceptable reason (to be determined by the CBL coordinator). Requests for excused absence have to be submitted in advance to the CBL coordinator. The student will be notified as soon as possible whether the request has been approved. Arriving late and/or leaving early to a meeting is also considered a no-show.
    </p>

    <h4 id="experimentalequipment">Experimental equipment</h4>
    <p>
      All components and equipment for the experiment are available in the SEL lab and must remain in there at all times. Every group gets a storage box in SEL, in which assembled components can be stored in between meetings. The available components cannot be modified irreversibly, and the use of components and/or tools not coming from the SEL lab is disallowed. If a component malfunctions, please report this to the teachers.
    </p>

    <!--PROJECT TRACKS AND STAGES-->
    <h2 id="stages">Project tracks and stages</h2>
    <p>The overarching project goal is to propose an Energy Storage and Transport (EST) system based on a validated model. The proposed EST system should be designed for your team's supply and demand:</p>

    </div>

    <p>The project is organized in four parallel, interconnected, tracks. Each track progresses in four stages:</p>

    <figure>
    <img src="assets/stages.png" alt="Tracks and stages" style="width:100%">
    </figure>

    <!--SYSTEM DEFINITION TRACK-->
    <h3 id="track1">Track 1: Defining your EST system</h3>
    <p>This track focuses on <em>defining the EST system</em> fitting your groups' supply and demand, while making use of the developed model. By the end of the project, the EST system, with all its components, should be specified:</p>
    <div class="block deliverable">
      <ul>
        <li>An <em>infographic</em> that gives a comprehensive overview of the EST system, including all essential system components and how these are interconnected.</li>
        <li>A complete <em>list of system parameters</em> which are essential to the performance of the EST system, such as component dimensions and material properties.</li>
        <li>A <em>performance assessment</em> of the EST system based on simulation results generated using the developed model to.</li>
        <li>A <em>scenario exploration</em> study to identify potential application directions.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h4>Stage 1: Conceptual idea of the EST system</h4>
    <p>The goal of the first stage of the system definition track is to come up with the conceptual idea of the EST system, which should be compatible with your team's energy supply and demand. The conceptual idea, including an outline of how the energy storage and transport solution can be applied in the real-world setting, will be presented in the Go/No-go pitch by means of a schematic with explanatory notes.</p>
    <div class="block questions">
      <ul>
        <li>Are all essential system components defined, or are certain components unnecessary/missing?</li>
        <li>Is there a notion of the size of the system and the relevant time scales involved in the storage process?</li>
        <li>How do storage bypass (direct delivery without intermediate storage) and load balancing (nullifying the mismatch between the energy supply/demand and the energy injected by/extracted from the storage) work in your system?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h4>Stage 2: Designing the EST system</h4>
    <p>The goal of the second stage of the system definition track is to elaborate all components of the EST system, identifying the parameters that are essential to the performance of the system. The results of this stage will be presented on the poster in the form of an infographic of the EST system, a list of system parameters, and a preliminary simulation result illustrating the feasibility of using the model to assess the performance of the system.</p>
    <div class="block questions">
      <ul>
        <li>Are all system components specified in such detail that the performance of the EST system can be assessed reliably?</li>
        <li>Is the list of essential system parameters complete, and do these parameters relate directly to the physical properties (e.g., dimensions, material properties) of the EST system?</li>
        <li>Which quantities/graphs are needed to assess the performance of the EST system, and can these be simulated by the model?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h4>Stage 3: Assessing the EST system and exploring scenarios</h4>
    <p>The goal of the third stage of the system definition track is to assess the performance of EST system using the consolidated model for the team's supply and demand, and to define and explore (using the model) different application scenarios for the EST system. The results of this stage will be presented in the technical report in the form of an improved infographic of the EST system, the complete list of system parameters required for the consolidated model, and detailed simulation results to assess the performance of the system in relation to the team's supply and demand. The model-based scenario exploration study will be presented in the technical briefing.
    </p>
    <div class="block questions">
      <ul>
        <li>Does the infographic target the right audience (a panel of experts), and does it reflect the level of professionalism ambitioned by your team?</li>
        <li>Are all system parameters required for the model specified for all considered simulation cases?</li>
        <li>Are all presented results generated using the (consolidated) model reproducible?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!--MODEL DEVELOPMENT TRACK-->
    <h3 id="track2">Track 2: Developing your EST model</h3>
    <p>This track focuses on <em>developing a model</em> capable of mimicking the behavior of your team's EST system. By the end of the project, a consolidated EST model should be developed:</p>
    <div class="block deliverable">
      <ul>
        <li>A comprehensive overview of the relevant physical processes and the mathematical relations to describe them.</li>
        <li>A Simulink model with custom MATLAB blocks for the proposed EST system.</li>
        <li>Technical documentation clarifying the relation between the mathematical model and the Simulink implementation.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>The development of a model is a key aspect of your project. It is therefore important to clarify the terminology related to modeling. The infographic below defines the most prominent modeling concepts and the relations between them. Make sure to <i>zoom in to see the detailed descriptions</i>.</p>
    
    <div id="map" style="width: 640px; height: 480px; background: #FFFFFF;"></div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        //Creating the Map
        var map = L.map('map', {attributionControl: false, zoomDelta: 1, zoomSnap: 1, crs: L.CRS.Simple, maxBounds: [[-480,-0],[0,640]], maxBoundsViscosity: 0.9}).setView([0,0],0);
  
        L.tileLayer('assets/map/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
        tileSize: L.point(640, 480),
        continuousWorld: false,
        noWrap: true,
        minZoom: 0,
        maxZoom: 2
        }).addTo(map);
    </script>

    <p>Your computer model will be developed in Simulink, based on the baseline implementation <a href="https://github.com/Energy-Storage-and-Transport/EST-model">available on Github</a>:</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="assets/simulink.png" alt="Simulink model" style="width:60%">
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The provided baseline implementation models the flow of energy between the different components. Energy losses are modeled using simplified models (see <a href="https://github.com/Energy-Storage-and-Transport/EST-model/#readme">documentation</a>). These simplified models are parametrized by <i>effective properties</i> of the components, meaning that the model parameters represent the overall behavior of the components (as if it where black boxes) and do not represent their physical attributes (dimensions, materials, etc.). This limits the applicability of the baseline implementation for studying (the design of) your team's EST system. In order to make the model applicable to your EST system, the simplified models based on effective properties must be replaced by appropriately selected <em>models based on physical properties of your EST system</em> (dimensions, materials, etc.).</p>

    <h4>Stage 1: Analysis of supply, demand & storage characteristics</h4>
    <p>
      The goal of the first stage of the <i>model development track</i> is to get acquainted with the baseline model provided in Simulink, and to use this model to analyze your team's supply, demand and storage characteristics. The results of this analysis will be presented in the Go/No-go pitch through a selection of simulation results.
    </p>

    <div class="block questions">
      <ul>
        <li>Did you obtain a thorough understanding of the Simulink model? Did you identify all components of the mathematical model (see <a href="https://github.com/Energy-Storage-and-Transport/EST-model/#readme">documentation</a>) in the custom MATLAB blocks?</li>
        <li>Did you import your team's supply and demand data?</li>
        <li>Can you estimate the effective properties in the baseline implementation based on the conceptual idea of your EST system?</li>
        <li>How do you intuitively and comprehensively describe and visualize the characteristics of the supply, demand and storage?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h4>Stage 2: Mathematical model selection and alpha-version</h4>
    <p>
      In the second stage of the model development track, you will explore modeling options (for the various system components) and select component models suitable for the purpose of your project. Based on the selected models, you will develop the first (alpha) version of your Simulink EST model. On the poster you will present an overview of the explored modeling options by means of a model-selection table.
    </p>

    <div class="block questions">
      <ul>
        <li>Are the model requirements for the essential components of the proposed EST system clear?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>What are the quantities of interest, and can these be determined by the model?</li>
          <li>Can the model parameters be related to the physical properties of the EST system?</li>
          <li>Given the purpose of the model, is it accurate enough, yet not unnecessarily complex?</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Has more than one modeling option been explored for the most prominent components of the model?</li>
        <li>Can the selected modeling options be implemented in MATLAB/Simulink?</li>
        <li>Is it clear that the modeling options are valid (for example, based on the literature) and is the relation to the experimental validation track clear?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h4>Stage 3: Model detailing and beta-version</h4>
    <p>
      The goal of the final stage of the model development track is to develop a consolidated (beta) version of the Simulink EST model, and to provide technical documentation for this model. Besides submitting the Simulink model, in the report you will detail the relations between the mathematical models and the implementation by a code-snippet-based discussion of the custom MATLAB blocks.
    </p>

    <div class="block questions">
      <ul>
        <li>Can you verify whether the implementation indeed solves the mathematical model?</li>
        <li>Can you develop (simple) tests to check your model?</li>
        <li>Did you follow good programming practices, such as code documentation and version management?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!--EXPERIMENTATION TRACK-->
    <h3 id="track3">Track 3: Validating the EST model</h3>
    <p>This track focuses on the <em>experimental validation</em> of one or more aspects of your EST model. By the end of the project, an experimental setup should be constructed, and an experiment should have been conducted and evaluated:</p> 
    <div class="block deliverable">
      <ul>
        <li> A <em>design of the experimental setup</em> (technical drawings, wiring schematics, sensor specifications, etc.), encompassing the used measurement instruments.</li>
        <li>A <em>measurement plan</em> which explains what is measured and how the measurement is to be conducted.</li>
        <li>A tangible <em>experimental setup</em> suitable for the intended measurements.</li>
        <li>An <em>in-class demonstration</em> of the experiment for the teacher.</li>
        <li>An <em>analysis of the experimental results</em>, including an assessment of the validity of the selected model aspect(s).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Your group is <em>free to choose which aspect(s) of the model to validate</em> with the experiment. In your choice, you should consider whether it can be realized using the components in the EST experimental toolboxes:</p>

    </div>

    <p>In addition to these toolboxes, a range of sensors and electronic components is available in the SEL lab.</p>

    <p>The components in the toolboxes should be used to <em>design and construct your own dedicated experiment</em>. An essential part of this design is the <em>integration of sensors</em> that automatically <em>gather data using an Arduino</em>. To get you acquainted with the use of sensors and Arduino-based data gathering, during Stage 2 you will follow a <em>measurement practical</em> (see <a href="https://canvas.tue.nl/courses/24206/assignments/104555">Canvas</a> for details).</p>
