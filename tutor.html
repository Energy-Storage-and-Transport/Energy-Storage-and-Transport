		<h2  id="role">The role of the tutor</h2>
		<p>As a tutor you play the role of a manager in the R&D department of an oil & gas company. The company's ambition is to transform into a sustainable energy company. In order to ignite this transition, various teams (the student groups) in the company are asked to come up with innovative energy storage and transport initiatives. You are supervising four of such teams. Your main objective is to ensure that the teams understand their responsibilities and operate professionally. It is very important that you do not steer the teams toward a particular solution, as this affects their technical autonomy and may impede innovation.​</p>

		<h2>Tutoring in the Energy Storage and Transport project</h2>
		<p>
			The Energy Storage and Transport project is designed using the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_alignment">constructive alignment</a>.
			The goal of constructive alignment is to obtain a project in which the learning outcomes (A), the learning process (B), 
			and the assessment (C), are in balance, as to achieve an optimal learning experience.
			As a tutor, especially in the context of challenge-based learning, you can have a strong influence 
			on the learning experience.
			It is therefore important to also align your tutoring style with the project, being aware that different aspects
			of the project require different styles.
			The chart shown below illustrates the intented tutoring style for the various aspects of the course,
			which will be detailed in the remainder of this section.
		</p>

		<h3>Tutoring styles</h3>
		<p>
			The table below defines four tutoring styles, ranging from a style in which the students are given
			a lot of freedom <strong>(I.)</strong>, to a style in which the tutor is very directive <strong>(IV.)</strong>.
		</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td><strong>I.</strong></td>
				<td><strong>Coaching</strong></td>
				<td>Let students take control and merely act as a supporting coach.</td>
				
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><strong>II.</strong></td>
				<td><strong>Probing</strong></td>
				<td>Ask questions to the students to aid them in their thinking process, but refrain from providing arguments.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><strong>III.</strong></td>
				<td><strong>Steering</strong></td>
				<td>Provide direction to the thinking process of the group by actively participating in discussions.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><strong>IV.</strong></td>
				<td><strong>Intervening</strong></td>
				<td>Give direct answers and/or show students how to proceed.</td>
			</tr>			
		</table>
		<p>
			A particular tutoring style can contain elements of the less directive styles. For example, when steering a group
			in a certain direction <strong>(III.)</strong>, it is often required to probe the group with critical questions <strong>(II.)</strong>.
			The other way around is not possible, however. That is, if you intend to only probe <strong>(II.)</strong> you should not
			steer <strong>(III.)</strong>.
		</p>

		<h3>Project aspects</h3>
		<p>The various aspects in the project, as shown in the chart above, are categorized following the principle of constructive alignment:</p>

		<h4>The overarching intended learning objectives (A)</h4>
		<p>This aspect of refers to the overall content and skills that students are expected to have mastered
			by the end of the project.</p>

		<table>
			<tr>
			  <th>A</th>
			  <th></th>
			  <th>In general</th>
			  <th>This project</th>
			  <th>Style</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><strong>1</strong></td>
				<td><strong>Challenge</strong></td>
				<td>The assignment given to the students/groups by the stakeholders. The challenge describe the context in which the students work, without indicating a precise solution.</td>
				<td>The <a href="./index.html">challenge</a> is completely specified. The tutor monitors whether the group is aware of the challenge.</td>
				<td>Probing</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><strong>2</strong></td>
				<td><strong>Solution</strong></td>
				<td>The range of possible end-points the students are allowed to reach in relation to the challenge.</td>
				<td>The students are free in their choice of the energy storage and transport system. The tutor only interferes in the case of safety concerns.</td>
				<td>Coaching</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><strong>3</strong></td>
				<td><strong>Methods</strong></td>
				<td>The range of (technical) approaches allowed to address the challenges in the project.</td>
				<td>The students follow a combined (numerical) modeling and experimental approach, with alignment between these approaches being an import aspect. The tutor can ask critical questions to stimulate the group's thinking process.</td>
				<td>Probing</td>
			</tr>  
		  </table>

		  <h4>The learning process (B)</h4>
		  <p>This aspect of refers to the activities (individually or in groups) that the students undertake to meet the learning objectives.</p>
  
		  <table>
			  <tr>
				<th>B</th>
				<th></th>
				<th>In general</th>
				<th>This project</th>
				<th>Style</th>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				  <td><strong>1</strong></td>
				  <td><strong>Individual learning activities</strong></td>
				  <td>The learning activities such as lectures, self-study asssignments, technical trainings, etc.
					that help each student to acquire the knowledge to work on the challenge.</td>
				  <td>The groups have to master, amongst others, skills to work with Matlab and Simulink, develop a
					sensor system using Arduino, create a professional infographic, and perform a scenario exploration study.
					The tutor participates in group discussions to ensure that the required skills will be developed (at the right time).
				</td>
				  <td>Steering</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td><strong>2</strong></td>
				<td><strong>Collaboration within the group</strong></td>
				<td>The way of working in the project groups, including group processes, roles, and agreements made.</td>
				<td>The students work closely together during the self-guided group meetings. During their weekly tutor-supervised meeting they provide a comprehensive status update.</td>
				<td>Coaching</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><strong>3</strong></td>
				<td><strong>Collaboration with stakeholders</strong></td>
				<td>The way in which stakeholders - which can be from academia, industry or society - are involved in the project. Students work on challenges developed at the university, and/or challenges provided by external stakeholders.</td>
				<td>The Energy Storage and Transport challenge is developed at the university, with the teaching team being the principal challenge owner.
					In the context of the challenge, the tutor is the direct manager of the group. This creates a mutual responsibility between the tutor and
					the groups to keep each other informed. External stakeholders will be invited to the technical briefings at the end of the project.</td>
				<td>Steering</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><strong>4</strong></td>
				<td><strong>Project management</strong></td>
				<td>The definition and scheduling of tasks and deliverables within the project, required to reach the solution.</td>
				<td>The deliverables and timeline in the Energy Storage and Transport project are largely specified. The tutor safeguards that the groups follow these specificaitons.</td>
				<td>Steering</td>
			</tr>			
		</table>


		<h4>The assessment procedure (C)</h4>
		<p>This aspect of refers to what will be evaluated (content, format and process) to ensure that the intended learning objectives are met.</p>

		<table>
			<tr>
			  <th>C</th>
			  <th></th>
			  <th>In general</th>
			  <th>This project</th>
			  <th>Style</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td><strong>1</strong></td>
			  <td><strong>Individual assessment</strong></td>
			  <td>The aspects on which students will be evaluated individually, such as their role in the group, their ability to collaborate effectively, and the effectiveness with which they employ their technical skills.</td>
			  <td>The students and their tutor follow the standard ESA procedure for the individual assessment, which includes a formative midterm
				evaluation and a graded final evaluation. With only one tutor-supervised meeting per week, it is important that both the students and
				the tutor actively participate in the exchange of information required for the tutor to perform the evaluation.</td>
			  <td>Steering</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			  <td><strong>2</strong></td>
			  <td><strong>Group assessment</strong></td>
			  <td>The content-related aspects on which students are evaluated, for instance: the solution, the technical process adapted to reach the solution, the communication of results, etc.</td>
			  <td>The group <a href="./index.html#assessment">assessment components</a> are fully described, and, where applicable, it is mandatory for the groups to follow the provided template. The tutor safeguards that students do not deviate from the instructions.
				The tutor does not proof-read and/or review any of the group deliverables.
