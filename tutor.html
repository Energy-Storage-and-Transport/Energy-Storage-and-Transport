		<h1>Welcome to the Energy Storage and Transport (EST) tutor page​</h1>
		<p>As a tutor you play the role of a manager in the R&D department of an oil & gas company. The company's ambition is to transform into a sustainable energy company. In order to ignite this transition, various teams (the student groups) in the company are asked to come up with innovative energy storage and transport initiatives. You are supervising four of such teams. Your main objective is to ensure that the teams understand their responsibilities and operate professionally. It is very important that you do not steer the teams toward a particular solution, as this affects their technical autonomy and may impede innovation.​</p>
